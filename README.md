# Password-Generator-

This is my Password Generator.
1. first you will be given a prompt to pick a number between 8-128.
2. Then you'll be asked a series of questions about what kind of characters you want the password to contain
3. If the information doesn't meet the needed criteria you will be alerted and have to start again.
4. Once all of the criteria has been met you should see the password generator spit out a random sequence of characters in which you can copy and use anywhere
